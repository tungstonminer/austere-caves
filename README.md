After playing modded Minecraft on 1.12 for a long while, I wanted to check out all the new stuff in vanilla Minecraft which has come out since then.  This modpack pulls in just enough mods to improve the vanilla experience without actually changing it.  Here's what's added:

* Terralith, Valhelsia Structures, Amplified Nether — augment the biomes and structures in the game using only vanilla blocks
* Areas, Random VIllage Names, Waypoints — create signs to designate a location as special, and find / create waypoints to teleport around
* Lightman's Currency, Player Trade — coins, vending machines, and ticketing systems to allow multiplayer commerce plus right-click a player to barter directly
* Chisels & Bits, Tiny Redstone, and Tiny Gates — carve 1/16th scale blocks with worked redstone parts
* Backpacked, Carry On — carry more items with you, and even pick up chests and animals
* Copper Equipment — create tools, weapons and armor from copper
* Storage Drawers — have multiple, small, single-item chests in the same block for easy access
* Gravestone Mod — all your stuff goes into a grave block in case you die
* Chunk Loaders — keep a part of the work active, even when you're away
* Finally Farmable — grow flowers for a reliable source of dye
