### Please answer the following questions

*What is your experience playing modded Minecraft?*

*Have you successfully been able to play *this modpack* in single-player?*

*What is your Minecraft username?*

### Please re-state the server rules in your own words

### Next Steps

Please be patient while waiting for your request to be considered!  Access requests are considered once per day, so you should generally receive a response in less than 24h.  In the meantime, you can set up your Minecraft instance to access the server at:

`austere-caves.sparkedservers.us`

Finally, it is *highly recommended* that you read [the wiki](https://github.com/tungstonminer/french-vanilla/wiki) for the modpack.  There are *a lot* of changes to world generation, mob spawning, ore placement, recipes and general game mechanics which will be very confusing otherwise.  **IN PARTICULAR**, please read the section on [etiquette](https://github.com/tungstonminer/french-vanilla/wiki/Etiquette) for some of the basic expectations that have developed among the players so far.
